<h2><a name="BioVeL"></a>BioVeL</h2>
<p>The Biodiversity Virtual e&#x2011;Laboratory (BioVeL) project,  led by the School of Computer Science and Informatics at Cardiff University,  has &#x20ac;5 million in funding and is seeking to provide a vital service that will improve the way scientists share,  analyse and present information in the growing area of biodiversity science. The project includes the application of Taverna, <a class="externalLink" href="http://www.myexperiment.org/">myExperiment</a> and the <a class="externalLink" href="http://www.biocatalogue.org/">BioCatalogue</a>.</p>
<p>Biodiversity science is the study of plants and animals that inhabit our planet and the environments they  live in. Amid growing concerns over the extinction rate of certain species as their natural habitats are increasingly  destroyed, and with biodiversity becoming as important as climate change on the political agenda, this new research project could not be more timely.</p>
<p>Biodiversity Virtual e&#x2011;Laboratory (BioVeL) will establish an international e-Laboratory &#x2013;  the first of its kind in Europe &#x2013; that will allow biodiversity scientists to jointly tackle diverse  research challenges.</p>
<p>Experts from Cardiff University along with 15 partners from institutions across Europe,  hope that when completed, the BioVeL e-Laboratory will, for the first time,  give scientists access to multiple data, analysis and computing resources for biodiversity science through  a robust e-Science infrastructure.</p>
<p>Ranked by the European Commission (EC) as top of its class from more than 60 proposals,  BioVeL is funded under the EC&#x2019;s FP7 e-Infrastructures programme to support the creation of the  European Research Area.</p>

<h2><a name="SCAPE"></a>SCAPE</h2>
<p><a class="externalLink" href="http://www.scape-project.eu/">SCAPE</a> (SCAlable Preservation Environments) is an EU-funded FP7 project aimed at building a scalable  platform for planning and execution of computation intensive processes for ingestion or migration of  large data sets in order to help automate digital preservation.</p>
<p>The data sets involved are either heterogeneous data collections (collections of objects of different type),  contain data objects that are themselves large or complex in structure or contain a huge amount of digital  objects. The sheer volume of data archives makes it impossible to use the current service-oriented architectures to  ensure access to digital information over time.</p>
<p>In this project, preservation processes will be realised as data pipelines and described formally as automated,  quality-assured preservation Taverna workflows. The workflows will invoke various services for planning  and execution of institutional preservation and quality assurance strategies. The workflows will be deployed on a large scale (using Hadoop MapReduce clouds) and executed over large,  distributed and heterogeneous collections of complex digital objects.</p>
<p>The workflows will enable reproducibility of preservation processes and collect provenance data over the  entire digital object&#x2019;s lifecycle.</p>
<p>The execution of workflows will be controlled by a policy-based &#x201c;planning and watch&#x201d; system, which will  ensure the workflows are in line with state-of-the art in digital object representation, file formats,  rendering tools, etc. and detect and report any errors in a preservation process.</p>

<p>by Schlarb Sven, <a class="externalLink" href="mailto:sven.schlarb@onb.ac.at">sven.schlarb@onb.ac.at</a>, Austrian National Library</p>
<p>SCAPE consists of testbeds that have three application areas: Digital Repositories,  from the library community, Web Content, from the web archiving community, and Research Data Sets,  from the scientific community. The testbeds are used to evaluate solutions developed by the SCAPE project against defined institutional  data sets in order to validate their applicability to real life application scenarios,  such as large scale data repository ingest-workflows or data archive maintenance.</p>
<p>Taverna is being used to develop concept workflows locally, to study the feasibility of differing approaches. Taverna server is used for remote execution of workflows,  with the Tool service in use as the main integration pattern.</p>
<p>In the context of how Taverna technology is currently used from a research perspective it is being used  as a tool for ETL (Extraction/Transform/Load) and creating query-able data tables from large  digital object collections. Content analysis and quality assurance are also performed using Taverna.</p>

<h2><a name="ChemTaverna"></a>ChemTaverna</h2>
<p>ChemTaverna is a pilot project currently being undertaken to investigate the application of Taverna in  cheminformatics by scientists at the School of Chemistry, University of Southampton in collaboration  with developers at the <a class="externalLink" href="http://www.mib.ac.uk/">Manchester Interdisciplinary Biocentre</a> (MIB).</p>
<p>A range of cheminformatics services are available for use in the Taverna Workbench &#x2013;  their <a href="/introduction/chemistry-web-services">descriptions and example workflows</a> showing how they can be used in data analyses are available  on-line. All cheminformatics services can be imported to the Workbench in one go in the form of the  <a class="externalLink" href="http://www.myexperiment.org/packs/135.html">Chemistry Service Set</a> , which is available from myExperiment as a Service Set Pack.</p>
<p>The results from cheminformatics workflows will be shared by means of blogs to provide a notebook record  of data analyses. The ChemTaverna project will also investigate how laboratory instrumentation can be controlled in workflows  for use in closed-loop optimization experiments to enhance the performance of analytical instruments.</p>
<p><a class="externalLink" href="http://usefulchem.wikispaces.com/">UsefulChem</a> project, an Open Notebook Science project in chemistry led by the Bradley Laboratory at  Drexel University, have created many useful chemistry workflows using Taverna. The workflows are described at Jean-Claude Bradley&#x2019;s <a class="externalLink" href="http://usefulchem.blogspot.com/">UsefulChem blog</a>.</p>

<p>This &#xa3;500,000 project is part-funded by the UK&#x2019;s national innovation agency,  the Technology Strategy Board (TSB) and is carried out by <a class="externalLink" href="http://www.eaglegenomics.com/">Eagle Genomics</a>,  a leading open-source bioinformatics service provider,  in collaboration with the myGrid/Taverna team and Cytocell Ltd., with assistance from <a class="externalLink" href="http://www.ngrl.org.uk/">NGRL</a>,  based at the Central Manchester University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust,  and the <a class="externalLink" href="http://www.manchesterbrc.org/index.php">NIHR Manchester Biomedical Research Centre</a>.</p>
<p>The project will build upon the success of the Taverna Workflow Management System in next generation  sequencing to enable medical researchers who are developing and testing new treatments to compare large  amounts of information analysed and stored on a cloud and find common genetic links.</p>
<p>The technology will also help clinicians to look at an individual patient&#x2019;s genetic make-up to aid diagnosis  and ongoing treatment.</p>
<p>Rather than simply testing a patient for one suspected condition,  using the cloud technology could allow clinicians to test for a much wider range of complaints.</p>
<p>Currently, the NHS IT systems do not have the resources to cope with the huge demands required. The cloud system can be accessed from a separate site, away from hospitals, freeing up space.</p>
<p>Eagle Genomics will work with the Taverna team to adapt Taverna to allow non-IT experts to easily add and  extract information and share it with their colleagues.</p>

<h2><a name="Taverna_2-Galaxy"></a>Taverna 2-Galaxy</h2>
<p><a class="externalLink" href="http://galaxy.psu.edu/">Galaxy</a> is an open, Web-based platform for data intensive biomedical research. Taverna 2-Galaxy integration is a first step towards making Galaxy and Taverna 2 more interoperable. It allows the automatic generation of Galaxy tools from Taverna 2 workflows. The tools can then be installed as usual in a Galaxy server and allow the Taverna workflows to become part  of a Galaxy pipeline. It has been developed by Kostas Karasavvas of <a class="externalLink" href="http://www.nbic.nl/">NBIC</a>.</p>
<p>Users do not need to install Taverna 2-Galaxy themselves. It is available as part of the myExperiment <a class="externalLink" href="http://www.myexperiment.org/">Web site</a>. While browsing Taverna 2 workflows the user will see an additional link &#x201c;Download as Galaxy Tool&#x201d; in the  download section of the workflow. The tool can then be installed into Galaxy in the usual manner by the Galaxy administrator. They will also need a <a href="/documentation/server">Taverna Server</a> that will run the Taverna 2-Galaxy tools.</p>

<p>The goal of the <a class="externalLink" href="http://www.e-lico.eu/">e-LICO project</a> is to build a virtual laboratory for interdisciplinary collaborative research in data mining and data-intensive sciences. The proposed e-lab will comprise three layers: the e-science and data mining layers will form a generic research environment that can be adapted to different scientific domains by customizing the application layer.</p>
<p>The foundation of the e-science layer is a suite of open source components from the myGrid e-science platform (one of which is the next generation Taverna Workbench). To build the e-LICO infrastructure, these components will be extended with tools for content creation (e.g. semantic annotation, ontology engineering), as well as mechanisms for multiple levels and modes of collaboration in experimental research.</p>

<p>The Taverna team were funded by the US National Cancer Institute (NCI) to help integrate Taverna with caGrid,  so that Taverna can find and use (secured and non-secured) caBIG data and analytical services found on caGrid.</p>
<p>The team wrapped a selection of typical non-caBIG services used by Taverna users so that they are annotated  and comply with caBIG&#x2019;s Silver-level compatibility requirements.</p>
<p>The team also implemented a plugin for Taverna 2.1.2 that enables semantic search for caGrid services  described by the caGrid&#x2019;s Index Service and adding them as component to workflows.</p>
<p>More details about the project and the deliverables can be found on the project&#x2019;s <a class="externalLink" href="http://www.mygrid.org.uk/dev/wiki/display/caGrid/Home">Wiki pages</a> and  NCI&#x2019;s Gforge project pages. Source code of the Taverna plugins is available from the <a class="externalLink" href="https://gforge.nci.nih.gov/svnroot/taverna-cagrid/">SVN repository</a>. The project ran from September 2008 to November 2009.</p>
<p>The work on the caGrid project follows on from caGrid&#x2019;s previous adoption of Taverna when the Taverna and  caGrid collaborated in 2007 to develop a Taverna 1.7.0 GT4 processor as a plugin based upon the  Taverna&#x2019;s WSDL processor. This work has been updated for Taverna 2.x and there are two plugins available: <a class="externalLink" href="http://www.taverna.org.uk/documentation/taverna-plugins/taverna-2-x-plugins#cagrid_plugin">caGrid plugin</a>  (for invoking caGrid services) and <a class="externalLink" href="http://www.taverna.org.uk/documentation/taverna-plugins/taverna-2-x-plugins#cagrid_remote_execution_plugin">caGrid remote execution plugin</a> (for remote execution of  caGrid workflows on a server).</p>

The project ran from July 2004 to June 2007.</p>
<p>The iSpider project developed three tools that make use of Taverna&#x2019;s functionality and plugability to  support the development of workflows, in particular for proteomics.</p>
<p>Much of the work has been done by Khalid Belhajjame and additional information can be found in his publications. A tool for the identification and the characterisation of mismatches in scientific workflows</p>
<p>By using the <a class="externalLink" href="http://www.mygrid.org.uk/tools/service-management/feta/">Feta</a> service registry and extending the capabilities of the Taverna Workbench,  this tool provides a means for automatically identifying and characterising the mismatches that may  arise between the constituent operations of an in silico experiments. A tool for automatically inferring service annotations</p>
<p>This tool allows the derivation, in an automatic fashion,  of information about the annotations of service parameters using existing tested-and-tried workflows. It has been evaluated using the workflow repository provided by <a class="externalLink" href="http://www.myexperiment.org/">myExperiment</a> together with the  <a class="externalLink" href="http://www.mygrid.org.uk/tools/service-management/mygrid-ontology/">myGrid ontology</a>. A system for querying multiple proteomics data sources</p>
<p>It supports the combined use of Grid data access (<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.ogsadai.org.uk/">OGSA-DAI</a>), Grid distributed querying (<a class="externalLink" href="http://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-3-540-24741-8_58">OGSA-DQP</a>) and  data integration (<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/automed/">AutoMed</a>) software tools to support distributed data analysis. This system has been used for providing an integrated access to four proteomics data sources, namely,  <a class="externalLink" href="http://gpmdb.thegpm.org/">gpmDB</a>, <a class="externalLink" href="http://pedro.cs.manchester.ac.uk/">PedroDB</a>, PepSeeker and <a class="externalLink" href="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/">Pride</a>.</p>
